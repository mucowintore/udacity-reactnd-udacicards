# UdaciCards

UdaciCards is a cross-platform mobile app that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

This project was tested on both iOS and Android.

## Installing

This project was bootstrapped with **Create React Native App**. To install and launch the project, do the following:
* `yarn install`
* `yarn start`

`npm` can be used in place of `yarn`.
